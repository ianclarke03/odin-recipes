    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil: You'll need about a quart of vegetable oil for frying the funnel cakes.</li>
        <l1>Milk: Milk lends moisture, ensuring a perfectly tender funnel cake.</l1>
        <l1>Eggs: Two eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they act as a binder for the batter.</l1>
        <l1>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the funnel cake batter.</l1>
        <l1>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</l1>
        <l1>Cinnamon and salt: Ground cinnamon and a pinch of salt enhance the overall flavor of the funnel cakes.</l1>
        <l1>Sugar: Sprinkle the funnel cakes with powdered sugar (a.k.a. confectioners' sugar) right before serving.</l1>
